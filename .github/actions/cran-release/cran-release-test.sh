# Copied from duckdb/duckdb-r's scripts/cran-release-test.sh at 86ac17f6b.
# Check .github/actions/cran-release/cran-release.sh offline, against a fake P3M on 127.0.0.1 and a `gh` stub: nothing reaches GitHub.
# Process: the header of .github/workflows/cran-submission.yaml
#
#   1. A draft whose version P3M does not list yet is one line in the report, and success.
#   2. A draft whose version P3M lists is published, once its tag points at its target.
#   3. A missing tag, and a tag at another commit, fail with a "How to resolve" section
#      and publish nothing.
#   4. No draft with the marker is nothing to do: no request to P3M, and success.
#   5. A dry run publishes nothing, and says what it would publish.
#   6. Only drafts carrying the marker of cran-submission.yaml, with the tag `v<version>`, count.
#
# The `gh` stub answers `gh api <path> --jq <program>` by running the program with jq
# over a JSON file named after the path, and records every call; `gh release edit` only records.
#
# Usage:
#   .github/actions/cran-release/cran-release-test.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   KEEP - if non-empty, do not delete the scratch directory
