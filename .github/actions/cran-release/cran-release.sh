# Publish the draft GitHub releases of CRAN submissions once Posit's package manager serves their version.
# Process: the header of .github/workflows/cran-submission.yaml
#
# .github/workflows/cran-submission.yaml drafts a release for every submission,
# and ends its notes with a marker that GitHub does not render:
#
#   <!-- cran-submission: <package> <version> -->
#
# This script lists the draft releases whose notes carry that marker and whose tag is
# `v<version>`, and checks each version against the source index of P3M's CRAN snapshot
# `latest`, the index `fledge:::release_after_cran_built_binaries()` reads with
# `utils::available.packages(repos = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest")`:
# the version is out when the index lists the package at exactly that version.
# A version that is out is published (`gh release edit <tag> --draft=false --latest`),
# after checking that the tag exists and points at the commit the draft targets;
# a missing or moved tag is reported, with how to resolve it, and nothing is published.
# A version that is not out yet, or no draft at all, is a line in the report and success,
# so a nightly run stays green while it waits.
#
# Usage:
#   .github/actions/cran-release/cran-release.sh [--dry-run]
#
# --dry-run checks everything and publishes nothing, saying what it would publish.
# Exit status: 0 when nothing failed, 1 when a draft could not be published, 2 on a usage error.
#
# Environment:
#   GH_REPO              the repository, owner/name; defaults to GITHUB_REPOSITORY
#   GH                   the gh command, default `gh`; .github/actions/cran-release/cran-release-test.sh stubs it
#   P3M_REPO_URL         the CRAN repository to check, default https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest;
#                        the test points it at a local server
#   GITHUB_ACTIONS, GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY, GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_REPOSITORY
#                        the log's groups and annotations, the report, and the commit links
#                        (.github/actions/cran-lib/cran-lib.sh)
