# Check release-pr-comment.sh offline, against a `gh` stub: nothing reaches GitHub.
#
#   1. Without an earlier comment, the run posts one on the pull request whose head is the ref.
#   2. With one, carrying the marker and written by github-actions[bot], the run updates it.
#   3. A comment with the marker by someone else is left alone.
#   4. Without a pull request for the ref, the labelled one is used; without either, nothing is posted.
#   5. The overall result is failure when any job failed, and the body lists every job.
#
# Usage:
#   .github/actions/release-pr-comment/release-pr-comment-test.sh
