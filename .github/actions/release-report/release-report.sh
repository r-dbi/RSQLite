# Post a workflow's result to the open release pull request, or to the release's checklist issue,
# as one comment per workflow that later runs update in place.
# Process: the header of .github/workflows/cran-submission.yaml
#
# The target is the open pull request whose head is the ref the run was started on,
# or, when ISSUE_MARKER is set, the open issue whose body carries that text instead:
# the checklist issue, which stays open from the cut until the release is published.
# Without a target, the script says so and succeeds: there is nothing to report to.
# The comment is found by the hidden marker `<!-- release-report: <key> -->`
# among the comments of github-actions[bot].
#
# Usage:
#   release-report.sh <key> <title>
#
# Environment:
#   GH_TOKEN, GH_REPO     the token and the repository, owner/name
#   GH                    the gh command, default `gh`; release-report-test.sh stubs it
#   RESULTS               one `<job>=<result>` per line, as `needs.<job>.result` gives it
#   DETAILS               Markdown appended below the job results, may be empty
#   ISSUE_MARKER          report to the open issue whose body carries this text, not to a pull request
#   GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_RUN_ID, GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER, GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT,
#   GITHUB_REF_NAME, GITHUB_SHA, GITHUB_EVENT_NAME
#                         the run that is reported
