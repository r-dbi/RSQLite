## Class: dbObjectId
##
## This mixin helper class is NOT part of the database interface definition,
## but it is extended by the Oracle, MySQL, and SQLite implementations to
## MySQLObject and OracleObject to allow us to conviniently (and portably) 
## implement all database foreign objects methods (i.e., methods for show(), 
## print() format() the dbManger, dbConnection, dbResultSet, etc.) 
## A dbObjectId is an  identifier into an actual remote database objects.  
## This class and its derived classes <driver-manager>Object need to 
## be VIRTUAL to avoid coercion (green book, p.293) during method dispatching.
##
## TODO: Convert the Id slot to be an external object (as per Luke Tierney's
## implementation), even at the expense of S-plus compatibility?
