Embeds the SQLite database engine in R, providing a DBI-compliant interface. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) is a public-domain, single-user, very light-weight database engine that implements a decent subset of the SQL 92 standard, including the core table creation, updating, insertion, and selection operations, plus transaction management.

You can install the latest released version from CRAN with:

```R
install.packages("RSQLite")
```

Or install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-dbi/RSQLite")
```

To install from GitHub, you'll need a [development environment](https://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites).

Discussions associated with DBI and related database packages take place on [R-SIG-DB](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-db).
The website [Databases using R](https://db.rstudio.com/) describes the tools and best practices in this ecosystem.

## Basic usage

```{r}
library(DBI)
# Create an ephemeral in-memory RSQLite database
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")

dbListTables(con)
dbWriteTable(con, "mtcars", mtcars)
dbListTables(con)

dbListFields(con, "mtcars")
dbReadTable(con, "mtcars")

# You can fetch all results:
res <- dbSendQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4")
dbFetch(res)
dbClearResult(res)

# Or a chunk at a time
res <- dbSendQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4")
while(!dbHasCompleted(res)){
  chunk <- dbFetch(res, n = 5)
  print(nrow(chunk))
}
# Clear the result
dbClearResult(res)

# Disconnect from the database
dbDisconnect(con)
```
