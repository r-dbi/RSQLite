# RSQLite

RSQLite embeds the SQLite database engine in R, providing a DBI-compliant interface. You can install the latest released version from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("RSQLite")
```

or install the latest development version from github with:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("RSQLite", "seth")
```

(Note that since RSQlite includes C code you'll need a [development environment](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites))
