\title{Was HTTP VFS compiled into this build?}
\usage{
sqliteHttpVfsCompiled()
}
\value{
A logical scalar.
}
\description{
Returns TRUE if the experimental HTTP/HTTPS virtual file system was compiled
in (libcurl detected at build time), FALSE otherwise. This is a compile-time
indicator; even if TRUE the VFS might still fail to register at runtime on
unusual platforms, in which case \code{sqliteHasHttpVFS()} is the definitive
runtime capability probe.
}
\details{
The eager registration performed in \code{.onLoad()} only runs when this
function returns TRUE. If FALSE, calls to \code{\link[=sqlite_remote]{sqlite_remote()}} will error unless
a supported build is installed.
