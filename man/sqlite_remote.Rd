\title{Open a remote SQLite database over HTTP/HTTPS}
\description{Convenience helper that constructs a SQLite URI filename for a remote SQLite database and ensures the HTTP VFS and immutable flags are set when available.}
\usage{sqlite_remote(url, immutable = TRUE, ...)
sqliteHasHttpVFS()}
\arguments{
  \item{url}{Character scalar; HTTP or HTTPS URL pointing to a SQLite database file.}
  \item{immutable}{Logical; if TRUE (default) appends \code{immutable=1} parameter to the SQLite URI to hint the database is read-only and unchanging.}
  \item{...}{Passed through to \code{DBI::dbConnect()}.}
}
\value{A \link{SQLiteConnection-class} object (for \code{sqlite_remote}); logical for \code{sqliteHasHttpVFS}.}
\details{This feature is experimental. It requires that RSQLite was built with libcurl support so that the optional HTTP VFS extension could be enabled. If unavailable, \code{sqlite_remote()} will error and \code{sqliteHasHttpVFS()} returns FALSE.

\strong{Not an official SQLite extension:} the bundled HTTP VFS is a minimal implementation intended for simple, read-only access to small immutable databases. Earlier versions downloaded the entire database eagerly; current builds may fetch pages on demand using HTTP Range requests with a small in-memory cache (still read-only). Writes are not supported. For large databases this may consume substantial memory or many round-trips. Prefer remote immutable databases and keep them small.

For more advanced HTTP VFS capabilities (range requests, read-ahead, helper sidecar files, worker pools, shared caches), see related projects in other ecosystems: C/C++ extension \code{sqlite_web_vfs} (\url{https://github.com/mlin/sqlite_web_vfs}), Rust crate \code{sqlite-vfs-http} (see crates.io), and JavaScript/WASM package \code{sqlite-wasm-http} (\url{https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite-wasm-http}).}
\examples{
if (sqliteHasHttpVFS()) {
  # Syntax-only example (URL must point to a real SQLite file to succeed):
  # con <- sqlite_remote("https://example.org/db.sqlite")
  # dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
  # dbDisconnect(con)
}
}
