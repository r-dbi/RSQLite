# Copied from duckdb/duckdb-r's scripts/cran-submit-test.sh at 86ac17f6b.
# Check scripts/cran-submit.sh offline, against a fake CRAN submission form on 127.0.0.1: nothing reaches CRAN.
# Process: the header of .github/workflows/cran-submission.yaml
#
#   1. `upload` sends the two POSTs of `devtools:::upload_cran()`, field for field and in order,
#      with the tarball's own bytes, the maintainer from DESCRIPTION and the comment `<package> <version>`,
#      and reports the next step: the confirmation e-mail.
#   2. A 404 reads CRAN's maintenance message from the index page and fails with it.
#   3. An upload without `pkg_id`, a confirmation without `submit=1`, a 500 and an unreachable form
#      each fail before the next POST, with a "How to resolve" section in the step summary.
#   4. A misnamed tarball, and a file that is no tarball, fail before anything is sent.
#   5. `upload --dry-run` sends nothing, and prints and reports every field a real run would post.
#   6. With R and pigz on the PATH: `tarball` builds a package, recompresses it with zopfli
#      and verifies it; a package that does not build, and a recompression that does not match,
#      fail with a "How to resolve" section; the built tarball then uploads as in 1.
#   7. Both stages name the commit: in CI the one checked out, linked, with a warning when it
#      is not the run's; outside CI the package directory's HEAD, unlinked, and `upload` none.
#
# The fake form answers as CRAN's does: the upload redirects to `index2.php?pkg_id=...`,
# the confirmation to `index2.php?submit=1`, and the server records every field it receives.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/cran-submit-test.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   KEEP - if non-empty, do not delete the scratch directory
