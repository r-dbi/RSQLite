# Build the source package, recompress it with zopfli, and upload it to CRAN the way `devtools:::upload_cran()` does.
# Process: the header of .github/workflows/cran-submission.yaml
#
# Two subcommands, one per step of .github/workflows/cran-submission.yaml,
# which keeps the tarball as an artifact of the run between them.
#
#   tarball [<out dir> [<package dir>]]
#     Build with `R CMD build` (which builds the vignette and runs `cleanup`),
#     recompress the result with zopfli (`gzip -dc | pigz -11`),
#     and verify that the recompressed tarball passes `gzip -t`
#     and holds the same tar stream, entry for entry, as the one R built.
#     The zopfli tarball lands in <out dir> (default: the current directory)
#     under the name R gave it, `<package>_<version>.tar.gz`.
#     <package dir> defaults to the root of this repository.
#
#   upload [--dry-run] <tarball>
#     Post the tarball to CRAN's submission form, then confirm it, as
#     `devtools:::upload_cran()` does (devtools 2.4.5 for the 404 path, 2.5.2 otherwise):
#     the upload sends `pkg_id` (empty), `name`, `email`, `uploaded_file`,
#     `comment` and `upload`, follows the redirects, and reads `pkg_id` from the final URL;
#     the confirmation sends `pkg_id`, `name`, `email`, `policy_check` and `submit`,
#     and succeeds when the final URL carries `submit=1`.
#     CRAN then mails a confirmation link to the maintainer, and the submission counts once it is clicked.
#     The comment is the single line `<package> <version>`;
#     the maintainer's name and e-mail come from the `Maintainer:` field
#     that `R CMD build` writes from the `cre` person in `Authors@R`.
#     A 404 means CRAN is closed for maintenance: the message on its index page is shown.
#     Nothing here asks for confirmation; this runs only when someone started it.
#     With --dry-run, nothing is sent: the stage checks the tarball as for a real run,
#     then prints and reports every field the two POSTs would carry.
#
# Each stage prints what it does and the values it uses, folded into groups
# and annotated with `::error::` or `::notice::` when GITHUB_ACTIONS is true.
# With GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY set, each stage also writes a Markdown report there,
# and every failure writes how to resolve it; the same advice goes to stderr either way.
# Exit status: 0 on success, 1 on a failed stage, 2 on a usage error.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/cran-submit.sh tarball "$RUNNER_TEMP/cran"
#   scripts/cran-submit.sh upload "$RUNNER_TEMP/cran/RSQLite_2.4.6.tar.gz"
#   scripts/cran-submit.sh upload --dry-run "$RUNNER_TEMP/cran/RSQLite_2.4.6.tar.gz"
#
# Environment:
#   CRAN_SUBMISSION_URL  the form to post to, default https://xmpalantir.wu.ac.at/cransubmit/index2.php
#                        (`devtools:::cran_submission_url`); scripts/cran-submit-test.sh points it
#                        at a local server
#   GITHUB_ACTIONS       `true` turns on the workflow commands (groups, annotations)
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY  the file the Markdown report is appended to; unset, no report is written
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT        the file `tarball` writes `package`, `version`, `tarball` and `sha256` to
#   GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_SHA, GITHUB_REF_NAME
#                        link the commit in the reports, and name the repository and ref
#                        in the dry run's advice on dispatching the real run; without them,
#                        `tarball` names the HEAD of the package directory, unlinked, and `upload` no commit
